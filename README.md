# CrowdData.tech - A Gemini API Developer Competition project

## Overview

Welcome to **CrowdData.tech** â€“ a collaborative platform designed to empower individuals to contribute to open-source datasets, which can be utilized by developers and researchers to create innovative AI models. Our mission is to enhance the quality of life by ensuring that AI models are built on diverse, high-quality data.

In addition to contributing to a better future, users of our platform are rewarded for their participation, with incentives such as tree planting and other environmental initiatives.

## Features

- **Crowdsourced Data Collection**: Users can upload and contribute data (e.g., images) to various datasets, helping to create diverse and high-quality training data for AI models.
  
- **Gemini API Integration**: We utilize the Gemini API to analyze and pre-screen uploaded images, automatically generating labels and filtering out irrelevant data, ensuring that the datasets are clean and useful.

- **Reward System**: While still in development, our platform will reward users for their contributions by offering incentives such as tree planting and other eco-friendly rewards.

- **Open Source**: All datasets and models created through our platform are open-source, fostering collaboration and transparency within the AI community.

## Technology Stack

- **Flutter**: Used for developing the mobile application, providing a seamless user experience across multiple platforms.
  
- **Gemini API**: Powers the image analysis and labeling features, ensuring that all data contributions are efficiently processed and categorized.
  
- **Firebase**: Serves as our primary database, managing user data, contributions, and rewards.
  
- **FastAPI**: Our backend is built using FastAPI, providing a fast, robust, and scalable foundation for the application.

## Project Goals

1. **Improve AI Model Accuracy**: By crowdsourcing diverse data and leveraging the Gemini API for intelligent preprocessing, we aim to create datasets that lead to more accurate and reliable AI models.

2. **Promote Environmental Sustainability**: Our reward system encourages users to contribute to environmental causes, making a positive impact on the planet while advancing AI research.
